### This is not an offical Google product

While developing apps we tend to think about dexs, jars, apks and classes as build/run time abstractions that just work. Most of the time this is true, however, when trying to debug runtime issues in large apps, things can sometimes get tricky.

After working with 3rd party dependencies and analysing crashes neither being able to view the sources nor having time time to learn the library, I wrote a tool to assist me. By looking inside the jars and dexes I can see how they work and which libraries they call. 

With ClassyShark analyzing dependencies is breeze. ClassyShark is fast and shows the right info (dependency classes,packages, methods and AndroidManifest) in no time. If your app is crashing or misbehaving at runtime and youâ€™re not sure why then ClassyShark may be able to help you.

Hope you find ClassyShark as useful and enjoyable as I do. Get started [here] (https://github.com/googlesamples/android-classyshark/blob/master/Get%20Started.md)
